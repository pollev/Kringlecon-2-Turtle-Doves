# Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves
This writeup is the collaborative work of:
- Polle Vanhoof
- Jan D'Herdt
- Honorable Mention goes out to Tudor Azoitei

For the 2019 SANS holiday hack challenge, Jan and myself decided to work together and tackle the interesting challenges presented by the SANS team. In the end, we completed all the challenges and objectives. As a nice bonus, we even stubled upon an oversight that allowed us to bypass all challenges and complete the game without completing any challenge.

We hope you enjoy this writeup as much as we enjoyed the game.

## Information Gathering
### Interacting with the game over websocket

The game started on a Friday evening and my colleague and I had agreed to start it together on Monday.
As a result, I was eagerly looking at the start of the event and trying to do anything other than actually working on the challenges.

I figured I would see how the game worked behind the scenes and started looking at the websocket traffic between my client and the server.
This quickly turned into a small project of itself. Soon I had a small script running and I decided I would use it to handle most of the information gathering.
A few hours later and [santas_little_helper.py](https://github.com/pollev/santas_little_helper) was born.

The following sections group the data we collected through the script.

### Oversight: End-Credits Bypass
While working on the data gathering script, I realized that I would need to automate the movement from room to room. The script could only pull data for a location after physically moving my character there. So I started working on a 'teleportation' option. The script interacts with the backend directly to move my character to each room, it then grabs all zone information it finds and stores it.

That info includes the new exit-portals for that specific zone. That means that, once we enter a zone, we can automatically figure out new locations we can go to and the script can then automate going to those new zones as well.

It turns out however that certain zones, which are supposed to only be accessible after completion of an objective, are still accessible if interacting with the websocket in this manner.
It is the client which refuses to enter these zones. The portals to the zones still exist, and we can force our way in by sending the appropriate command to the server. It seems the devs forgot to do some server side validation here.

After discovering this, I added a 'teleportation' feature to the script. Which can teleport your character directly to any zone (including the finale zone)

#### Solution
We have a look at the door keypad and see that the keys "1", "3" and "7" have been used.
We are also told that one of those numbers is used twice.

The immediate thing to try would be "1337" (or 'leet'). However this number is not prime. We could solve this challenge by grabbing a list of primes from the internet and removing all entries that have a digit not equal to 1, 3 or 7. We could then remove all entries that do not have a duplicate digit. We can then just write a script to try all the remaining possibilities.

Or you could do what we did, try the first options that come to your mind, one of them being '7331' (the reverse of 1337) and get lucky.

That's all there is to this challenge, we do however find a little easter egg on the wall inside the dorm after we enter the now unlocked door. It seems the ElfU students need a reminder sometimes and have written the code down on the wall.

I need to list files in my home/
To check on project logos
But what I see with ls there,
Are quotes from desert hobos...

which piece of my command does fail?
I surely cannot find it.
Make straight my path and locate that-
I'll praise your skill and sharp wit!

Get a listing (ls) of your current directory.
```

#### Solution
We quickly see that someone has messed with the path.

```
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ ls
This isn't the ls you're looking for
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ which ls
/usr/local/bin/ls
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```
There is a fake `ls` binary in /usr/local/bin. And that directory is first in our path.
As a result, linux will search that path first and find the bad `ls` binary and use it.

We could now fix the path, or just use the correct binary directly.
So we just run `/bin/ls` instead.

```
elf@bd2b9636c43a:~$ /bin/ls
```

That's it. We are done.

I love that nyancat!

Run commands, win, and done!

Log in as the user alabaster_snowball with a password of Password2, and land in a Bash prompt.

Target Credentials:

username: alabaster_snowball
password: Password2
```

#### Solution
If we just try to `su` to alabaster_snowball, we see something very unexpected happen:
![NYAN-NYAN-NYAN](images/nyanshell.png)


We look at '/etc/passwd' to see what shell is being loaded for alabaster snowball:

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin

backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin
list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin
irc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin
gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
_apt:x:100:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
elf:x:1000:1000::/home/elf:/bin/bash
alabaster_snowball:x:1001:1001::/home/alabaster_snowball:/bin/nsh
```

We notice that alabaster_snowball is running the strange shell `/bin/nsh`
if we look at this shell we see its permissions and notice that we should be able to overwrite it.
However, if we actually try, we get a permission denied

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ ls -la /bin/nsh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 75680 Dec 11 17:40 /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ echo '' > /bin/nsh
-bash: /bin/nsh: Operation not permitted
```
Looking at `sudo -l` we see that we are only allowed to run one specific command as root:
```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for elf on 1fd924a3fa2c:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User elf may run the following commands on 1fd924a3fa2c:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/chattr
```
So we can run `chattr`
The `chattr` command is used to change file attributes on a Linux file system.
Lets have a look at the current attributes for `/bin/nsh`

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ lsattr /bin/nsh
----i---------e---- /bin/nsh
```

We see that the immutable flag is set. That is why we cannot overwrite the file.
We can however use the `chattr` command to remove this flag ourself.

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ sudo /usr/bin/chattr -i /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ lsattr /bin/nsh
--------------e---- /bin/nsh
```

Indeed, now we can overwrite the shell. So we just overwrite it with the real bash shell and we are ready.
We then just `su` to alabaster_snowball with the provided credentials and we are done.

```
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ cp /bin/bash /bin/nsh
elf@1fd924a3fa2c:~$ su alabaster_snowball
Password:
Loading, please wait......


You did it! Congratulations!
```

That's all there is to this challenge!

Hello dear player!  Won't you please come help me get my wish!
I'm searching teacher's database, but all I find are fish!
Do all his boating trips effect some database dilution?
It should not be this hard for me to find the quiz solution!

Find the solution hidden in the MongoDB on this system.
```


#### Solution
We start by trying to connect to the mongo database

```
elf@de490e548003:~$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
2019-12-17T15:00:26.355+0000 W NETWORK  [thread1] Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:27017, in(checking socket for error after poll), reason: Connection refused
2019-12-17T15:00:26.356+0000 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed :
connect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:251:13
@(connect):1:6
exception: connect failed


Hmm... what if Mongo isn't running on the default port?
```

It seems that we need to find the port mongo is listening on.
We can do this by running the following command:

```
elf@de490e548003:~$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
elf          1  0.0  0.0  18508  3496 pts/0    Ss   14:53   0:00 /bin/bash
mongo        9  0.5  0.0 1016780 59484 ?       Sl   14:53   0:02 /usr/bin/mongod --quiet --fork --port 12121 --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --logpath=/tmp/mongo.log
elf         54  0.0  0.0  34400  2928 pts/0    R+   15:01   0:00 ps aux
```
Alternatively, we could have checked out `sudo -l`
```
elf@de490e548003:~$ sudo -l
User elf may run the following commands on de490e548003:
    (mongo) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mongod --quiet --fork --port 12121 --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --logpath\=/tmp/mongo.log
    (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python /updater.py
```
In either case, we see that there is a mongo process running with the port flag 12121.
We connect to it and look around:
```
elf@de490e548003:/tmp$ mongo localhost:12121
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://localhost:12121/test

#### MOTD
When we start the terminal, we are greeted with the following message (I added an image rahter than a transcript to preserve the coloring here):
![Smart braces motd](images/smart_braces_motd.png)

#### Solution
This challenge is timed. You need to complete the iptables rules within 5 minutes. Note that there is nothing stopping you from trying multiple times. So the time limitation is not much of a problem.
We start by checking out the IOT Teeth Braces document:
```
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ cat /home/elfuuser/IOTteethBraces.md 
# ElfU Research Labs - Smart Braces
### A Lightweight Linux Device for Teeth Braces
### Imagined and Created by ElfU Student Kent TinselTooth

This device is embedded into one's teeth braces for easy management and monitoring of dental status. It uses FTP and HTTP for management and monitoring purposes but also has SSH for remote access. Please 
refer to the management documentation for this purpose.

## Proper Firewall configuration:

The firewall used for this system is `iptables`. The following is an example of how to set a default policy with using `iptables`:

> sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

The following is an example of allowing traffic from a specific IP and to a specific port:

> sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -s 172.18.5.4 -j ACCEPT


A proper configuration for the Smart Braces should be exactly:

1. Set the default policies to DROP for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.
2. Create a rule to ACCEPT all connections that are ESTABLISHED,RELATED on the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains.
3. Create a rule to ACCEPT only remote source IP address 172.19.0.225 to access the local SSH server (on port 22).
4. Create a rule to ACCEPT any source IP to the local TCP services on ports 21 and 80.
5. Create a rule to ACCEPT all OUTPUT traffic with a destination TCP port of 80.
6. Create a rule applied to the INPUT chain to ACCEPT all traffic from the lo interface.
```

Let's implement these rules.

```
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 172.19.0.225 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 172.19.0.225 --sport 22 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 21,80 -j ACCEPT
elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m multiport --sports 21,80 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

elfuuser@e8bce7331ea7:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```
We now wait a couple seconds for the background task to verify our rules and we are done.


NOTE:
> There seemed to be some small issues with this challenge where if you did not allow the MOTD to slowly play out, it would no longer properly verify your rules later.

#### Game Overview
The game is a reference to the legendary game series [Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)).
When we start we get to select our difficulty. The difficulty refers to how hard it is to hack into the game, not just the difficulty of the game itself.
The game can be properly played, but the goal is ofcourse to win it by cheating.


Here are some screenshots to give you an idea of what this is all about.


First we can select our difficulty:

![Trail Select Game](images/trail_select_game.png)

Then we always start at the following shop screen. There are some interesting things you can do here, but all challenges can be solved without really interacting with this screen. So we just always accept the default values and continue.

![Trail Shop](images/trail_shop.png)

The next image shows what the game itself looks like. Note the 'URL-bar' to simulate a real browser game.
The goal is to cover the distance of 8000 without losing all your characters. Pressing 'Go' will increase your distance travelled and trigger all kinds of events.

![Trail Easy](images/trail_easy.png)

If you manage to complete the game, the result looks like this:

![Trail Solved](images/trail_solved.png)

#### Solution
We will go over each of the difficulties, even though only one is required to get the achievement.

##### Easy mode
We start of course with the easy challenge. We notice from the screenshots above that the URL contains a buch of GET parameters.
Remember that the goal is to cover the full 8000 distance without losing before that point.

We immediately notice the 'distance' parameter in the url bar. We try to update it to 7999 and press enter.
The game screen updates to this:

![Trail Easy Solution](images/trail_easy_solution.png)

Great! We kept all our guys alive and we only need to travel a distance of 1 now. We simply press 'Go' once and we have completed the first challenge!

##### Medium mode
We load into the medium difficulty version of the game and notice one huge difference, the parameters are no longer in the URL!

![Trail Medium](images/trail_medium.png)

This time, they are being passed as POST parameters. We could easily intercept the requests with burp and modify them how we want, but lets keep it even more simple.
We can just have a look at the page source and notice that there is a `<div>` element called `statusContainer`. This value contains all the variables that were previously kept in the url bar.
We update again the value of distance to 7999.

![Trail Medium Solution](images/trail_medium_solution.png)

We now press 'Go' once and we have completed the Medium challenge!

##### Hard mode
This is where things get interesting. This challenge is identical to the medium difficulty, with one key exception.
The `statusContainer` object this time also contains a hash value. The server sends us this hash value together with all of the other status values.

![Trail Hard](images/trail_hard.png)

This hash is taken on the server side over all of the other status values. If we update any values and send them back to the server, the server will compare them to the hash we send it.
If they do not match, the server will reject our request and tell us that we have an issue:

![Trail Hard Oops](images/trail_hard_oops.png)

While we were originally stuck here for a little while, we decided to throw one of the hashes we received in [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/). To our suprise, the hash was known:

![Trail Crackstation](images/crackstation.png)

The Hash is just an md5 of the value '1626'! This tells us two important things:
1. The server is not using a key to secure their hashes
2. The hashes are of a (very simple) numeric value

After playing around with the game status and the received hashes for a while, we determined that the server was just adding up all the status values and taking a hash of the total. We could have also figured this out by watching the talk [Web Apps: A Trailhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T6-DQtzCgM). At a certain point, the server side code for calculating the hash shows up on screen, also showing us how the hash value is being calculated:

![Trail Talk](images/trail_talk.png)

Our objective is now simple, we update two values:
- The distance
- The hash

Start of with a clean slate (hash of value 1626) and we increase the distance from 0 to 7999. We then generate a hash `md5(1626 + 7999)` and change the hash value to reflect that.
In linux we can do this easily:
```
polle@polle-pc:~ $ echo -n "$((1626 + 7999))" | md5sum
a330f9fecc388ce67f87b09855480ca3  -
```
There we have our new hash value. We update both values in the source code as we did for the medium challenge and we press 'Go' once.

We have completed the hard challenge! That was fun!

#### Solution
Upon logging in with the provided credentials, we end up on the search interface for graylog.

![Graylog](images/graylog_main.png)

We are provided with 10 different challenges that we need to solve.

##### Challenge 1
Objective:
> Minty CandyCane reported some weird activity on his computer after he clicked on a link in Firefox for a cookie recipe and downloaded a file.
> What is the full-path + filename of the first malicious file downloaded by Minty?

Solution:
> C:\Users\minty\Downloads\cookie_recipe.exe

Search:  
We can simply search the logs for a filename containing the word cookie.
```
TargetFilename:/.+cookie.+/
```


##### Challenge 2
Objective:
> The malicious file downloaded and executed by Minty gave the attacker remote access to his machine.
> What was the ip:port the malicious file connected to first?

Solution:
> 192.168.247.175:4444

Search:  
```
CommandLine:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/
```
Now find the execution of the .exe and search for events in a scope of 1 minute around that event
We then also quickly find the network connection  
Alternatively, we can look for
```
ProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.exe/
```
And find the EventId of 3 (network traffic)

##### Challenge 3
Objective:
> What was the first command executed by the attacker?

Solution:
> whoami

Search:  
We can search for all commands (processes) that have the cookie recipe as the parent process
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```

##### Challenge 4
Objective:
> What is the one-word service name the attacker used to escalate privileges?

Solution:
> webexservice

Search:  
We can reuse the last search we did
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```
And then track the userAccount value for each process over time.
We will see that soon the user executing commands with that parent process is no longer minty.
The last action executed as minty shows us the process used to escalate


##### Challenge 5
Objective:
> What is the file-path + filename of the binary ran by the attacker to dump credentials?

Solution:
> C:\cookie.exe

Search:  
We continue with the same search string we were using before.
```
ParentProcessImage:/.+cookie_recipe.+/
```
We see that the attacker mistypes and tries to run mimikatz. He then corrects himself and runs the binary named cookie.exe.


##### Challenge 6
Objective:
> The attacker pivoted to another workstation using credentials gained from Minty's computer.
> Which account name was used to pivot to another machine?

Solution:
> alabaster

Search:  
Windows Event Id 4624 is generated when a user network logon occurs successfully. We can also filter on the attacker's IP using SourceNetworkAddress.
```
EventId: 4624
```


##### Challenge 7
Objective:
> What is the time ( HH:MM:SS ) the attacker makes a Remote Desktop connection to another machine?

Solution:
> 06:04:28

Search:  
LogonType 10 is used for successful network connections using the RDP client.
```
EventID: 4624 AND LogonType:10
```

##### Challenge 8
Objective:
> The attacker navigates the file system of a third host using their Remote Desktop Connection to the second host.
> What is the SourceHostName,DestinationHostname,LogonType of this connection?

Solution:
> elfu-res-wks2,elfu-res-wks3,3

Search:  
The attacker has GUI access to workstation 2 via RDP.
They likely use this GUI connection to access the file system of workstation 3 using explorer.exe via UNC file paths 
This is likely why we don't see any cmd.exe or powershell.exe processes.
```
SourceHostName:"ELFU-RES-WKS2" AND EventID:4624
```
However, we still see the successful network authentication for this with event id 4624 and logon type 3.

##### Challenge 9
Objective:
> What is the full-path + filename of the secret research document after being transferred from the third host to the second host?

Solution:
> C:\Users\alabaster\Desktop\super\_secret\_elfu\_research.pdf

Search:  
We can look for sysmon file creation event id of 2 with a source of workstation 2.
We can also use regex to filter out overly common file paths using something like:
```
source:"elfu-res-wks2" AND EventID:2 AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+AppData.+/ AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+updatestore.+/ AND NOT TargetFilename:/.+AppData.+/
```

##### Challenge 10
Objective:
> What is the IPv4 address (as found in logs) the secret research document was exfiltrated to?

Solution:
> 104.22.3.84

Search:  
We can look for the original document in CommandLine using regex.
```
super_secret_elfu_research.pdf
```
When we do that, we see a long a long PowerShell command using Invoke-Webrequest to a remote URL of https://pastebin.com/post.php.
We can pivot off of this information to look for a sysmon network connection id of 3 with a source of elfu-res-wks2 and DestinationHostname of pastebin.com.

Alternatively, select the poweshell command and view events in a 5 seconds window around it.

That is all for the graylog terminal!
