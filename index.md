# Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves
This writeup is the collaborative work of:
- Jan D'Herdt
- Polle Vanhoof

For the 2019 SANS holiday hack challenge, Jan and myself decided to work together and tackle the interesting challenges presented by the SANS team. In the end, we completed all the challenges and objectives. As a nice bonus, we even stubled upon an oversight that allowed us to bypass all challenges and complete the game without completing any challenge.

We hope you enjoy this writeup and maybe learn something from it as well.
